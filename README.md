pooh-bot
===
*A simple Discord bot that helps keep your server family friendly.*

![demo](demo.gif)

Reads messages from non-private channels and adds the `:pooh:` emoji as a reaction to any messages containing swear words. Also watches for edits, and adds/removes the reaction as necessary. Falls back to ðŸ’© if `:pooh:` is unavailable as a server emoji.
